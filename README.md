# Packit mentoring

This repository serves as a resource for potential mentees in mentoring programs like Outreachy, providing guidance on how to contribute to Packit.

Packit is an open-source project aimed at integrating upstream projects with downstream distributions, streamlining the packaging and release process. We welcome contributions from the community and encourage new contributors to get involved!

## Getting started

To contribute, check out the issues labeled **good-first-issue** in our repositories:

- [Packit repository](https://github.com/packit/packit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue)
- [Ogr repository (a library used by Packit)](https://github.com/packit/ogr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue)

We regularly add new issues, so there may be fresh opportunities to contribute!

If you're interested in an issue, check the comments and assignees to ensure no one else is working on it. Then, comment on the issue to let us know you'd like to take it on, and be sure to mention which mentoring program you're participating in (GSOC or Outreachy).

You may assign the issue to yourself, and a mentor will move it to the "in progress" state and add a label corresponding to your mentoring program.
